# ETL Weather Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow

## Overview

This project implements an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to fetch weather data from a specified source (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API, a public dataset, etc.), process it, and load it into a target system (e.g., a database, data warehouse, or flat files). The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow and is designed to run within a Dockerized environment managed by the Astro CLI (or can be adapted for other Airflow setups).

**Purpose:**
*(Describe the main goal of your project. For example: "To collect daily temperature and precipitation data for major cities, transform it into a consistent format, and store it for historical analysis." Replace this with your project's specific purpose.)*

## Key Features

*   **Data Extraction:** Fetches weather data from [Specify your data source, e.g., OpenWeatherMap API].
*   **Data Transformation:** [Describe the transformations, e.g., Cleans data, converts units, aggregates hourly data to daily summaries].
*   **Data Loading:** Loads the transformed data into [Specify your target, e.g., PostgreSQL database, S3 bucket].
*   **Scheduled Execution:** Uses Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring the ETL pipeline.
*   **Containerized Environment:** Runs within Docker containers for consistency and portability.
*   **(Add any other specific features of your pipeline)**

## Technologies Used

*   **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Key Python Libraries:** [e.g., `requests` for API calls, `pandas` for data manipulation, `psycopg2` for Postgres interaction, etc. List what you actually use in your DAGs]
*   **Data Source:** [e.g., OpenWeatherMap API, specific CSV files, etc.]
*   **Data Target:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, CSV files, etc.]
*   **Development Environment:** Astro CLI (or specify if you used a different local Airflow setup method)

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Astro CLI/Airflow structure:

*   `dags/`: Contains the Python files for your Airflow DAGs.
    *   `weather_etl_dag.py`: *(Rename this to your main DAG file name)* This DAG defines the tasks for extracting, transforming, and loading weather data. *(Briefly describe what your main DAG(s) do here. Replace the example_astronauts description.)*
*   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image based on Astro Runtime, including any custom dependencies.
*   `include/`: For any additional files or scripts needed by your DAGs (e.g., SQL query files, helper Python modules).
*   `packages.txt`: Lists OS-level packages to be installed in the Docker image.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python packages to be installed (e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-postgres`, `requests`, `pandas`).
*   `plugins/`: For custom Airflow plugins, if any.
*   `airflow_settings.yaml`: (Local development only) For defining Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools without using the UI. *(Specify if you've used this for API keys or other configurations for your weather project).*

## Setup and Running the Project Locally

These instructions assume you are using the Astro CLI.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Docker Desktop installed and running.
    *   Astro CLI installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd ETLWeather
    ```

3.  **Configure Connections/Variables (if needed):**
    *   If your DAG requires API keys or specific connection details (e.g., for the weather API or a target database), define them. You can add them to `airflow_settings.yaml` for local development or set them up via the Airflow UI once it's running.
    *   *Example `airflow_settings.yaml` entry for an API key variable:*
        ```
        airflow:
          connections: []
          variables:
            - variable:
                key: weather_api_key
                value: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
          pools: []
        ```
    *(Make sure to instruct users to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and not commit actual keys to `airflow_settings.yaml` if the repo is public. Better to mention setting them via UI or environment variables for sensitive data).*

4.  **Start Airflow Locally:**
    ```
    astro dev start
    ```
    This command builds the Docker image and starts the Airflow components (Postgres, Webserver, Scheduler, Triggerer).

5.  **Access Airflow UI:**
    *   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.
    *   Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`.
    *   You should see your `weather_etl_dag` (or your DAG's name) listed. You can unpause it and trigger a run.

6.  **Verify Docker Containers:**
    You can check if all containers are running with:
    ```
    docker ps
    ```

7.  **Access Local Postgres Database (Airflow Metastore):**
    The Airflow metadata database is accessible at `localhost:5432/postgres` (Username: `postgres`, Password: `postgres`).

## Understanding the DAG(s)

*(This is a crucial section. Elaborate on your specific DAG(s) here.)*

*   **`weather_etl_dag.py`** *(Use your actual DAG file name)*
    *   **Purpose:** Orchestrates the end-to-end process of fetching, transforming, and loading weather data.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   `extract_weather_data`: [Describe what this task does, e.g., "Calls the OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather for specified cities."]
        *   `transform_weather_data`: [Describe what this task does, e.g., "Cleans the raw JSON response, converts temperatures to Celsius, and structures the data."]
        *   `load_weather_data_to_db`: [Describe what this task does, e.g., "Writes the transformed data into a PostgreSQL table named 'weather_reports'."]
        *   *(Add/remove tasks based on your actual DAG structure)*
    *   **Schedule:** [Specify how often it runs, e.g., "Runs daily at 01:00 UTC."]

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

*   [e.g., Add more data sources (historical weather, forecasts)]
*   [e.g., Implement more complex transformations or data quality checks]
*   [e.g., Integrate with a BI tool for visualization]
